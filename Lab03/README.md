# Lab 03: Rendering a Triangle

Students registered in the Game Graphics Programming course will conduct each lab based on Direct3D 11. Each lab works are an incremental development of a basic rendering engine, thus they are not independent. For this reason, we recommend the students to stay focused to the teaching assistant (TA). Through this lab, one can draw a single triangle.
