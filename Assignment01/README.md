# Assignment 01: Minecraft's Creative-Mode-Like First-Person Camera

Students registered in the Game Graphics Programming course will conduct each assignment based on Direct3D 11. Each assignment work is an incremental development of a basic rendering engine, thus they are not independent. For this reason, we recommend the students to stay focused to the teaching assistant (TA). Through this assignment, one can develop a no-clip frea-roaming camera similar to that of the game Minecraft.
