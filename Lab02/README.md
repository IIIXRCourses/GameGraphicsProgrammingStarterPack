# Lab 02: Object-Oriented Design

Students registered in the Game Graphics Programming course will conduct each lab based on Direct3D 11. Each lab works are an incremental development of a basic rendering engine, thus they are not independent. For this reason, we recommend the students to stay focused to the teaching assistant (TA). Through this lab, one can reorganize their basic Direct3D 11 code object-orientedly.
